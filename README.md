## 📈 Pet Projects

<p>For obvious reasons, I can't publish the developed commercial code as my pet projects) After all this work I don't have any energy left for pet projects, but I'm hoping for the best</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm trying to gain as much experience as possible from work and apply it. Sometimes I pop into LeetCode to solve a couple of problems</p>
<p>P.S. Old pet projects, such as first steps in Go or frontend projects from the old days can be found in the repositories here. So that after looking at my code, you admit that only a true gigachad could have programmed this</p>
