- 👋 Hi, I’m @sufetter
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend(Node js (Express/Nest) and learning GO now),
  I’m also familiar with Frontend (now I work with it as a hobby) and already worked with Next JS, Thustand/Redux and etc.
- 🌱 Now I am a student of the Belarusian State Technological University, I study in the specialty of Information Systems and Technologies in the third year.
- 💞️ Now I am a Backend developer and would be glad to receive advice and useful information from everyone.
- 📫 How to contact me, my email is --> lobunetsdaniil@yandex.ru or vk.com/mrhenschel (2nd method is preferable).

// A lot of projects are private due to the presence of shitty code or especially incompleteness in them
// Many of them (including main) are not deployed due to the lack of confidence in their usefulness,
// for example, that I eventually want to follow the development path with this language


//I hope the number of such projects will increase in the near future 🗿
